Create by a Rick and Morty fan for Rick and Morty fans. This website uses an API pulled from https://rickandmortyapi.com/
to create a little database of all 493 characters, 76 locations and 31 episodes.

Along with the completely obscene characters is a quiz that will tell YOU! which of the 493 characters you are!
go on... give it a shot. 

The thick of the code is in survey.js
